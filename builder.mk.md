# builder.mk

This is the main makefile exposed by the cpp-project-builder. It contains standard recipes to build C/C++/Assembly multiplatform projects using a GCC-based compiler.

> **Assumptions**
>
> * Although complex arrangements can be made using the build system, in order make easier the explanation of the concepts, it will be assumed a project containing a single makefile responsible by the compilation/distribution process.
>
> * From this point onwards, the project source root directory will be referred as `$(PROJ_ROOT)` and this is the directory where project's main makefile is located.
>
> * The directory where build system is installed will be referred as `$(CPP_PROJECT_BUILDER)`.

## Default directories

When present, these directories will be used (by default) with the following purposes:

> NOTE: `$(PROJ_ROOT)` does not accept whitespaces

* **`$(PROJ_ROOT)/include/`**

  Contains platform-independent public includes (header files) used by application during build.

  This directory will be added to compiler's [include search path](#INCLUDE_DIRS).

  By default, if project is a [library](#PROJ_TYPE), all files contained in this directory will be copied to the [output-directories](#output-directories).

  > **Skip default include source directory**
  >
  > THIS IS A FEATURE OF LAST RESORT!
  >
  > Default include directory can be ignored by the build through the definition of [`SKIP_DEFAULT_INCLUDE_DIR`](#SKIP_DEFAULT_INCLUDE_DIR) variable.

* **`$(PROJ_ROOT)/src/`**

  Contains platform-independent source files and private headers used by application during build. Any kind of file can be placed into this directory, but only C/C++/Assembly source files will be compiled. The file types are identified according to filename suffixes (values are case-sensitive):

  * C sources:**.c**
  * C++ sources: **.cpp**, **.cxx**, or **.cc**
  * Assembly sources: **.s** or **.S**

  This directory is also added to compiler's [include search path](#INCLUDE_DIRS).

  > **Skip default source directory**
  >
  > THIS IS A FEATURE OF LAST RESORT!
  >
  > Default source directory can be ignored by the build system through the definition of  [`SKIP_DEFAULT_SRC_DIR`](#SKIP_DEFAULT_SRC_DIR) variable.

* **`$(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/`**

  This directory is assumed to contain platform layers for the project.

  For details regarding platform layers, see [multiplatform projects](#multiplatform-projects).

  > **Skip default hosts directory**
  >
  > THIS IS A FEATURE OF LAST RESORT!
  >
  > Default hosts directory can be ignored by the build system through the definition of [`SKIP_DEFAULT_HOSTS_DIR`](#SKIP_DEFAULT_HOSTS_DIR) variable.

## Output directories

All generated-files produced by the building process are placed into an output base directory (defined by the variable [`O`](#O)). By default, this directory is located into `$(PROJ_ROOT)/output/`.

For example, in order to put output files into a directory named `/output/directory`, just override the `O` variable during the call to `make` by passing its value through command line arguments:

```sh
make O=/output/directory
```

> **Version control**
>
> The output base directory shall be ignored by your source code version control system if it is located inside your source tree.

Inside output base directory ([`$(O)`](#O)) you may find directories (some of them exists only for certain [types of projects](#PROJ_TYPE)) grouped by target host platform ([`$(HOST)`](#HOST)) and build mode ([debug or release](#DEBUG)):

* **`$(O)/$(HOST)/<debug-or-release>/build/`**

  Build directory. This directory contains object files as well as final artifact (application executable or library).

  This path can be obtained through [`O_BUILD_DIR`](#O_BUILD_DIR) read-only variable and customized through [`BUILD_SUBDIR`](#BUILD_SUBDIR) variable.

* **`$(O)/$(HOST)/<debug-or-release>/dist/`**

  Distribution directory. Final artifact (executable or library), and possibly companion files (e.g. header files, for libraries) are placed into this directory.

  This path can be obtained through [`O_DIST_DIR`](#O_DIST_DIR) read-only variable and customized through [`DIST_SUBDIR`](#DIST_SUBDIR) variable.

  > **Additional distribution files**
  >
  > Additional directories and/or files to be distributed along with resulting distribution can be added through usage of [`DIST_DIRS`](#DIST_DIRS) and [`DIST_FILES`](#DIST_FILES) variables.

  * **`$(O)/$(HOST)/<debug-or-release>/dist/bin/`**

    If project is an [application executable](#PROJ_TYPE), resulting distribution binary will be placed into this directory.

  * **`$(O)/$(HOST)/<debug-or-release>/dist/lib/`**

    If project is a [library](#PROJ_TYPE) (either [static or shared](#LIB_TYPE)), resulting binary will be placed into this directory.

  * **`$(O)/$(HOST)/<debug-or-release>/dist/include/`**

    If project builds a [library](#PROJ_TYPE) (either [static or shared](#LIB_TYPE)), public headers (if any) will be placed into this directory.

## Multiplatform projects

The build system was created with the concept of platform layers in mind, which means that platform customizations can be made by adding a specifc layer on top of a generic one.

In order to clarify the concepts, lets assume an example project which will be supporting the following hosts: `linux-x64`, and `linux-arm-v7`. For this example project, the following layers can be added (note that layer arrangement is up to the developer):

* `linux`
* `linux-x64` (applied on top of `linux` layer)
* `linux-arm` (applied on top of `linux` layer)
* `linux-arm-v7` (applied on top of `linux-arm-v7` layer)

> NOTE: layer components must be delimited by a dash (`-`)

If you are compiling this example project to `linux-arm-v7` host, select the compilation host through [`HOST`](#HOST) variable. The recommended way is to set the variable through a command line paramenter (although is perfectly legal to hardcode a value into a `$(PROJ_ROOT)/Makefile`):

```sh
$ make HOST=linux-arm-v7
```

During the build, the following layers will be applied to this project:

* `linux`
* `linux-arm` (applied on top of `linux` layer)
* `linux-arm-v7` (applied on top of `linux-arm-v7` layer)

> Note that `linux-x64` layer will be skipped when building the for this host, since it is not a compatible layer.

Similarly, when building to `linux-x64` host, set the [`HOST`](#HOST) variable during the build:

```sh
$ make HOST=linux-x64
```
And the following layers will be applied:

* `linux`
* `linux-x64` (applied on top of `linux` layer)

> Note that `linux-arm` and `linux-arm-v7` layers will be skipped when building the for this host, since they are not compatible layers.

### Layer directories and files

For each supported layer, there is expected to be a subdirectory inside [hosts directory](#default-directories) with its name corresponding to the layer. This location can contain any files/subdirectories, but the following ones have special meaning for the build system:

<a name="layer-src-dir"></a>
* **`$(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/<layer-name>/src/`**

  If present, this directory is expected to contain layer-specific source files, which will be compiled when layer is compatible with selected [`HOST`](#HOST).

  > This directory will also be added to compiler's [include search path](#INCLUDE_DIRS).

<a name="layer-host-mk"></a>
* **`$(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/<layer-name>/host.mk`**

  If present, this makefile will be autoamtically included by the build system when layer is compatible with selected [`HOST`](#HOST). This is useful to add custom build flags and/or libraries for chosen layer.

  For example, while building a project (which has custom makefiles for the layers `linux`, `linux-arm` and `linux-arm-v7`) for the host `linux-arm-v7`, the following sequence of includes will be performed automatically by the build system:

  1. `include $(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/linux-arm-v7/host.mk`
  2. `include $(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/linux-arm/host.mk`
  3. `include $(PROJ_ROOT)/hosts/linux/host.mk`

### CROSS_COMPILE variable

When building for a custom target host other than native one, it is required to set the [`CROSS_COMPILE`](#CROSS_COMPILE) variable. This variable must contain the prefix to be added to toolchain binaries. For example, `g++` on a toolchain for `linux-arm` may be called `linux-arm-g++`. In this example, `CROSS_COMPILE` shall be equal to `linux-arm-` (NOTE the trailing dash).

## Make targets

The following diagram shows all targets exposed by this makefile and their dependencies:

> NOTE: Dashed arrows represent execution of one target after another (target pointed by the arrow is executed before the target at arrow base), and not a dependency between targets.

```

<a name="all"></a>
* **`all`**

  Default target. Just depends on [dist](#dist) target.

<a name="clean"></a>
* **`clean`**

  Removes all compiled artifacts.

  Its internal rules are preceeded by the targets declared in [`PRE_CLEAN_DEPS`](#PRE_CLEAN_DEPS) variable, and are followed by the targets declared in [`POST_CLEAN_DEPS`](#POST_CLEAN_DEPS) variable.


<a name="build"></a>
* **`build`**

  Compiles all source files and generates the target binary artifact (executable application or library).

  Its internal rules are preceeded by the targets declared in [PRE_BUILD_DEPS](#PRE_BUILD_DEPS) variable, and are followed by the targets declared in [`POST_BUILD_DEPS`](#POST_BUILD_DEPS) variable.

  > **NOTES**
  >
  > * If project does not contain source files, no binary artifact will be generated (Howerver, targets declared in [PRE_BUILD_DEPS](#PRE_BUILD_DEPS) and [`POST_BUILD_DEPS`](#POST_BUILD_DEPS) will be executed)
  >
  > * Additional dependency targets for the binary artifact may be added through the [ARTIFACT_DEPS](#ARTIFACT_DEPS) variable.

<a name="dist"></a>
* **`dist`**

  Generate distribuition tree.

  Its internal rules are preceeded by the targets declared in [PRE_DIST_DEPS](#PRE_DIST_DEPS) variable, and followed by dependencies declared on [POST_DIST_DEPS](#POST_DIST_DEPS) variable.

  > See [`DIST_DIRS`](#DIST_DIRS) and [`DIST_FILES`](#DIST_FILES) in order to check how to add extra files/directories to the distribution.

<a name="print-vars"></a>
* **`print-vars`**

  This target is used mostly for debugging purposes. It prints the contents of the variables declared in variable [`VARS`](#VARS).

  For example, to get the value of both [`SRC_DIRS`](#SRC_DIRS) and [`SRC_FILES`](#SRC_FILES):

  ```sh
  $ make print-vars VARS='SRC_DIRS SRC_FILES'
  ```

  Generates the following output (for [c-app demo](../demo/c-app)):

  ```
  SRC_DIRS = src
  SRC_FILES = src/main.c
  ```

## Variables

The build system provided by this makefile uses special defined variables in order to customize how project is built.

Some variables are expected to be defined exclusively on any or your project's makefiles, some of them are recommended to be defined on command line, and others are read-only (i.e. contains utility information generated by the build system and cannot be modified by the user/project).

All supported variables are described below:

> **Variable details**
>
> For each detailed variable, the following fields refer to:
>
> * **Description:** contains descriptive information about the variable.
> * **Mandatory:** defines if a variable must be defined during build.
> * **Default value:** contains the value which will be assumed if variable is optional and it is not defined (NOTE that the default value may not be available during [plaform layer](#multiplatform-projects) customizations).
> * **Ready for layers:** defines if variable values are can be assumed as fully defined during platform layer customizations (e.g. default value for [`INCLUDE_DIRS`](#INCLUDE_DIRS) variable will be applied only after layers were parsed).
> * **Allowed origins:** defines where variable is allowed to be defined (command line, environment, file, etc).
> * **Restrictions:** Contain information about restrictions on which kind of values that can be stored in the variable.

### Command-line variables
